# BUGS:

  * exists, many
  * cyrillic letters 'ั' and 'ะต' must be treat as same
  * non-alphabet sorting in /sequencebooks request
  * genre links in book description

# ToDo:

  * remove join's from db requests (too slow) -- testing
  * add search in sequences
  * create/fill new database in new filename and move it in new command './managedb.py commit'
  * refactor it! some functions not in right place, some need to be deleted, may be split some submodules.
