# BUGS:

  * too slow search, sometimes 500 with search in book title -- need testing

# ToDo:

  * add search in sequences
  * create/fill new database in new filename and move it in new command './managedb.py commit'
  * refactor it! some functions not in right place, may be split some submodules.
