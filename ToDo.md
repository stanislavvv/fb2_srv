# BUGS:

  * exists, many
  * space in filename == wrong url (.../read/f.fb2-396347-399579.zip/Roman ...)
  * cyrillic letters 'ั' and 'ะต' must be treat as same in ids generation

# ToDo:

  * up speed in /author/.../sequenceless request
  * add search in sequences
  * create/fill new database in new filename and move it in new command './managedb.py commit'
  * refactor it! some functions not in right place, some need to be deleted, may be split some submodules.
